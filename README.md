&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 7 (CSE241) [HEX Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game))

    1901042643_HW7.java => Hex game in Java with a GUI.
                           Uses grid layout, JButtons for each cell, Radio and
                           Chekbox buttons for player options, TextField inputs will be for board size, Jbuttons
                           for game reset, load and save games, button for single step undo, HexGame Interface
                           that defines all methods, properly overridden clone method

&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 1

    main.java => Design and implementation an automation system for a company that sells office furnitures.
    
&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 3

    main.java => Part 1: Implementation of the same system using several implementations of the List abstract data structure.
                 Part 2: Time Complexity of all methods.

&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 4

    heap.java => Implementation of Search for an element, Merge with another heap, Merge i'th another heap, Extend the Iterator
                 class by adding a method to set the value (value passed as parameter) of the last element returned by the next
                 methods for heap data structure.
                 
    BSTHeapTree => BSTHeapTree class that keeps the elements in a Binary Search Tree where the nodes store max-Heap with a maximum
                   depth of 2 (maximum number of elements included in a node is 7)

    Part 3: Time Complexity of all methods.


&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 5

    Part 1 => Custom iterator class MapIterator to iterate through the keys in a HashMap data structure in Java.
    Part 2 => Implement KWHashMap interface in the book.
              -Use the chaining technique for hashing by using linked lists (available in the text book) to chain items on the same table slot
              -Use the chaining technique for hashing by using TreeSet (instead of linked list) to chain items on the same table slot.
              -Use the Coalesced hashing technique.

&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 6

    Part 1 => Design and implement an e-shopping application that has two user roles as usual: traders and customers.
              Read csv file for datas. Use ArrayList, LinkedList, Queue, Tree, Hash Table properly.


&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 7

    Part 1 => Provide two partial implementations of NavigableSet interface: skip-list and AVLTree.
    Part 2 => Write method that takes a BinarySearchTree and checks whether the tree is an AVL tree or a Red-Black tree.
    Part 3 => Compare insertion performance of the following data structures.
                - Binary search tree implementation in the book
                - Red-Black tree implementation in the book
                - 2-3 tree implementation in the book
                - B-tree implementation in the book
                - Skip list implementation in the book

&emsp;&emsp;PROJECT 8

    Part 1 => Generalize the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm.
    Part 2 => Write two methods to find the number of connected components in a graph: one using BFS and the other using DFS.
